## About

I'm Jacques Kaiser, born in France, global citizen.

Throughout my studies, I lived and worked in four different countries - France, England, Australia and Germany. Graduated with an international Master degree in computer graphics, vision and robotics, I am now working as a robotics engineer in FZI and simultaneously pursuing a PhD within the Human Brain Project.

Aside from my studies, I have cumulated years of experience working in web development for startups. Proficient full-stack developer, I pick up new technologies very quickly.
