Internship of 2 months in the computer graphics research team at iCube, Strasbourg.

During this internship, I developed an application for mesh editing on a virtual reality platform.
In order to be realtime, I built it upon [CGoGN](http://cgogn.unistra.fr/ "CGoGN"), a powerful library that provides an efficient implementation of combinatorial maps, maintained by the iCube laboratory.

We used the user avatar optimized for depth perception which I developed during my [previous internship]({% post_url 2011-08-01-iCube-internship %} "First iCube internship") at the lab.
