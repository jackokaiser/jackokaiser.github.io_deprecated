I am currently employed as a robotics engineer at [FZI research center for information technology](http://www.fzi.de/en/home/ "FZI"), and simultaneously pursuing a PhD within the [Human Brain Project](http://www.fzi.de/en/research/projekt-details/human-brain-project/ "Human Brain Project at FZI") in [Neurorobotics](https://neurorobotics.net "Neurorobotics in the Human Brain Project").

As a robotics engineer, I am involved in a variety of robotics projects, with a focus on computer vision, machine learning and web development.

As a PhD student, I am developing spiking network models to learn robot control from event-based vision.
I also participate in the development of the Neurorobotics platform, a web-app wiring brain simulations with robotic simulations.
