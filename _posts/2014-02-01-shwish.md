Shwish is an Australian startup providing an online collaborative gifting platform, that is like Kickstarter for your friends' wishes and projects.

Part of a small team, I had the chance to work on every side of the project: design implementation, front-end, back-end, database and devOps.
The web-app was built upon the popular MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express.Js, AngularJS, Node.js.
