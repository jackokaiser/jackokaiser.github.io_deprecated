Internship of 2 months in the computer graphics research team at iCube, Strasbourg.

The positioning issue refers to the fact that, desptite the improvments of 3D technologies, it remains hard to guess relative depth of objects in space.
I implemented solutions where the cursor (the user avatar) gives hints on its position by scaling and orienting itself toward the closest object in space.
We tryed out many different shapes and textures to find out the one yielding the best depth perception.
The final version of the cursor has successfully been used for terrain editing on a 3D workbench platform.
