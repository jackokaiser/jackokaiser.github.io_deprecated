Internship of 5 months in [skimlab](http://www.skimlab.com/ "skimlab"), a startup providing web-based 3D modelling tools.

The business model is to provide an easy online tool for modelling 3D objects which relies on implicit surface.
Thanks to the implicit surfaces, designed 3D models are certified to be 3D printable, since their volume is mathematically defined.
Users can therefore 3D print their models, which are shipped to them.
The startup also released [jweel](https://www.jweel.com/en/ "jweel"), a similar platform focusing on the design of jewelry.

I worked on WebGL shader development to enhance and speed up rendering.
It involved good knowledge of JavaScript, Three.js, glsl and WebGL.
